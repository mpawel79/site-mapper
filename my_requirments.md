I want to build agent that will crawl given site and build map on connections basing on clicked buttons links and provided data to use on specific sites. The sites are for schedulig visit, finding a location or answering quieze, questionary questions. Agent should build graph of transitions between pages, retaing the page name, summary of conntent, source pages, destination page -  with what to click to access them eg link, button name text, and screenshot of it. The graphs should allow to build  the map with all the connections.
